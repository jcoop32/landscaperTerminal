-You win the game when you have a team of starving students and $1000. In this situation, send a message to the user telling them, theyâ€™ve won.


Game Flow:
if users bank balance is below $5 -> run cutGrassTeeth
if the users bank is above $5 then ask if they want to upgrade to scissors 
  if yes -> run cutGrassScissors()
  if no -> keep running cutGrassTeeth()
if users bank is above $25 then ask if they want to upgrade to an old-timey push mower
  if yes -> run cutGrassPushMower()
  if no -> run current cutGrass function
